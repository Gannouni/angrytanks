angrytanks
==========

A schoolproject made with a classmate in Java. A game where 2 tanks need to shoot eachother. (the game is programmed in Dutch)
The java code is located here: 'angrytanks/src/be/kdg/angrytanks'. To run the game go to 'angrytanks/out/artifacts/angrytanks_jar'
and run 'angrytanks.jar'. Nomally it should work if you have JRE installed. The game is playable and quite fun to play!
